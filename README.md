### Featured Projects

1. [Proyect 1](https://github.com/mansilladiego/MIPrimerSpringDiego)
### School Management System

This project is a School Management System developed using the Spring Framework. The system consists of four main entities: User, Teacher, Student, and Course. Each entity is managed through a complete set of Spring components, including controllers, entities, repositories, rest controllers, services, and service implementations.

**Key Features:**

- **User Management:** Allows the creation, editing, and viewing of user data, including teachers and students.

- **Course Administration:** Facilitates course management, teacher assignment, and tracking of enrolled students.

This project is a showcase of my experience in developing applications using cutting-edge technologies like Spring. I'm excited to share this implementation and to continue exploring new opportunities in the world of programming.
